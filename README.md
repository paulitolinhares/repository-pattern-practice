# Repository pattern practice

The goal of this project is to practice the repository design pattern using Typescript, NodeJS, Express and Prisma

I created a single `Post` entity to demonstrate how the pattern could be implemented for CRUD operations

## How to run the project

- npm install
- npm run dev

Go to `https://localhost:3000`

Available URLs:

- GET /posts - returns all posts
- POST /posts - creates a new post
- GET /post/:id - returns a post with a certain id

## TODOs

- [x] Add Update and Delete operations
